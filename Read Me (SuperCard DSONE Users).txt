I decided to do something different for a change and do something that hasn't been done for years. I updated the SCC
cheats for those that use the original DSONE/i kernels without EOS. SCC cheat support was dropped a long time ago but
I picked it back up again with modern day cheats integrated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to add and use the SCC cheats:
There is three methods to make this work.

1. Renaming the cheat(s) to match the ROM scene release number
Some ROMs on the internet have numbers in front of the ROM name(s) for many reasons, one major reason being that they
are scene release numbers. SCC cheats can take advantage of that when you rename the cheat(s) to the ROM scene release
number.

Example:
Say your ROM was named like so, "3541 - Pokemon - Platinum Version (USA)", you would change your SCC cheat file name to
"3541". This method can be frustrating at times because not all the ROMs you download have a scene release number in
front of the ROM name.

To use this method, your cheats will need to be in the right place on your microSD card:
scshell\cheat


2. Renaming the cheat(s) to match the ROM name
This method is simpler than method one, all you have to do is name your cheat(s) the same name as your ROM(s). This method
requires you to stick the SCC cheat(s) in the SAME directory where your games are located.

Example:
Say your ROM was named like so, "Pokemon - Platinum Version (USA)", you would change your SCC cheat file to match the ROM name.

To use this method, your cheats will need to be in the right place on your microSD card:
scshell\yourgamesfolderhere


3. Renaming the cheat(s) to match the game ID's
This method CAN be frustrating however it is my prefered method for the cheats. This method is very useful because then you
don't have to use and or update the ndsinfo.dat file anymore, instead the flashcart will recognize that the cheats are labeled
as the game ID's and use them without the need of the ndsinfo.dat.

Example:
Say your ROM was "Pokemon - Platinum Version (USA)", you would rename the SCC cheat file to matched the game ID, "CPUE_d074d1b3".
Finding the ID's online isn't hard at all.
