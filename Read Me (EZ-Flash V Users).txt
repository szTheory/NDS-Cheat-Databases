EZ-Flash V, V Plus, Vi Users:
===============================================================================
These flashcarts have had quite a few different methods to run cheats, however there is one cheat method that some users have had
trouble with over the years until newer kernel versions came out, replacing these old formats with the usrcheat.dat database.
This older database was called EZARCode.dat, a similar database to the usrcheat.dat database. With this knowledge and the right
tools, I have successfully revived the EZARCode.dat database for those that still use the older EZ-Flash V, V Plus, and Vi kernel
versions under 2.0.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to add and use the EZARCode.dat cheat database:

Step #1:
Make sure the moonshl folder and the ez5sys.bin file is on the root of your SD card.

Step #2:
Make sure you have the latest resetsp.bin file inside the moonshl folder, most of the kernels automatically came
with the latest version available.

Step #3:
Create a folder named CHT onto the root of your SD card.

Step #4:
Drag and drop or copy and paste the EZARCode.dat file inside the CHT folder.

That's all there is to it, just enable the cheats and go from there. Enjoy!
