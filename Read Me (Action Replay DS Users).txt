Action Replay DS/DSi Users:
===============================================================================
These devices use the cheats.xml database, however due to a ~2.5MB size limitation, it's impossible to import the entire
cheat database into the cheat device. You will have to utilize the Action Replay DS/DSi P.C. software and pick and choose
which titles you want to use cheat codes on.

NOTE:
Please make sure you are using the latest dedicated firmware version for your respective cheating device, that way you have
full access to any potential title compatibility and or bug fixes.
